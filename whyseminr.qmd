title: "Why SEMinR"
---

What is the result of a PLS-SEM analysis? You have probably seen research papers using path models such as the followng. These are the outputs of structural equation modeling and can be generated using SEMinR.

SEMinR is an R package designed to make structural equation models (SEM) approachable to practitioners across disciplines. 
It is an *open-source* and *free* tool that practitioners can use immediately with minimal setup.
SEMinR's syntax offers a domain-specific language to define structural equation models using R syntax. 
The syntax is designed with the needs and knowledge of SEM practitioners foremost in mind.
While we focus on partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) in this tutorial, SEMinR also includes covariance-based SEMs and covariance-based confirmatory factor analysis.
SEMinR has functions named after the major features of a SEM model.
For example, consider a PLS-SEM model that has several *composite* or *reflective*  *constructs* that are measured by *multiple items* (e.g., survey questions), with causal *paths* *from* a certain set of constructs *to* others. 
The syntax for this model might look like this:

```r
measurements <- constructs(
  reflective("Image",      multi_items("IMAG", 1:5)),
  composite("Expectation", multi_items("CUEX", 1:3)),
  composite("Loyalty", 	   multi_items("CUSL", 1:3), weights = mode_B),
  composite("Complaints",  single_item("CUSCO")))

structure <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("Image", "Expectation"), to = c("Complaints", "Loyalty"))
```

Comparing our description of the model to the syntax, we can see that the functions we use correspond to the nomenclature of SEM models that practitioners use: the measurement model is defined using functions called `constructs()`, `reflective()`, `composite()`, and `multi_items()`; and the structural model is defined by functions using `relationships()`, and `paths()`. 
This makes SEMinR's syntax highly readable and interpretable to new and expert SEM practitioners alike.
